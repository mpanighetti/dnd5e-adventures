# Chateau Rousseau

_**By Mario Panighetti**_

**Level:** 5

> [!WARNING]
> **CONTENT WARNING:** This one-shot adventure contains mentions of parental neglect, child death, and cannibalism, though none of these are depicted explicitly in the current events of the story and are only referred to in retrospect.

## Objective

The party's goal should be to escape Chateau Rousseau. There are multiple prescribed methods of achieving this:

- If they collect all three hidden signet rings, they can unlock the front door and leave Chateau Rousseau freely.
- If they kill Goren, the house fades away around them.

In either case, all the spirits trapped inside the house, including the Rousseau children, are freed to move on from this pocket dimension. However, if the front door is opened without stopping Goren, he too is released from his prison, and leaves to unknown realms to pursue his hunger.

## Suggested house rules

Player death is always a possibility in Dungeons & Dragons, but Chateau Rousseau particularly indulges in taking the life of its inhabitants. To that end, a few house rules regarding character creation and running the game are recommended:

- All party members start with either a common or uncommon magic item, or an additional 200 gold pieces.
  - Any gold can be spent before the adventure on additional equipment if desired.
  - Spells that consume material components of value are satisfied by having an equivalent amount of gold (after which the gold is consumed like normal material component usage). For this reason, spellcasters are recommended to start with extra gold if they plan on using more powerful spells.
- Attuning to items works as normal, but Attunement takes 1 minute instead of requiring a short rest.

If a player character dies, the character immediately returns as a ghost. They regain all spell slots, and other features are restored as if they completed a long rest, with the following changes:

- Their Hit Point Maximum is halved.
- Their creature type changes to Undead.
- All their attack actions count as magical damage for the purpose of overcoming resistance or immunity.
- When engaged in combat against Goren, they are considered to be heavily obscured from him, as he has difficulty perceiving ghosts.
- If a ghost character is reduced to zero Hit Points again, they are destroyed and cannot be restored to life short of divine intervention, the _wish_ spell, or similarly powerful features.

If the party succeeds in escaping Chateau Rousseau or defeating Goren, ghost players come back to life and leave with the rest of the party, unless their spirits were destroyed.

## Setup

The party awakens in a row of beds in an unfamiliar room, fully equipped, armed, and with all their magical abilities prepared, but with no memory of how they got here. The individuals may or may not know each other, and could even come from different worlds entirely.

The room is simple with minimal decor, and visible boards in the walls and ceiling indicating an attic. Everyone is laying in small beds possibly built for children, each with a nightstand. Some wardrobes stand across the room next to a single door presumably leading downstairs. Motes of dust float through the air, and small windows to either side of the bed are covered with grime and dust but let through a faint green light.

### Exposition ghost

As the group takes in their surroundings, they spot a young elven woman waiting for them at the foot of the bed. "Oh good, you're finally awake!" she exclaims as she claps her hands together. "You're probably wondering what you're all doing here, but first I'd love to get to know you all better. My name's Anni, short for Annifrid, eldest of the Rousseaus. What's yours?"

The party can take this time to introduce themselves to Anni and each other, but they also might press her for questions, in particular where they are and how to get home. Anni is an open book but will leave a few details about the situation unstated until they come up in normal conversation. Up front, Anni will reveal the following:

- The party is in Chateau Rousseau.
- They were brought here by Lynistad Rousseau, a powerful mage and Anni's mother.
- Anni has three siblings: Ulvaeus, Neta, and Goren.
  - Ulvaeus loves sports and hunting and is probably in the game room.
  - Neta loves to read and is usually in the library, though she's read every book in the house at this point.
  - Goren is probably wandering around looking for something to eat.
- Goren became sick, so Lynistad put the children and the house here while she tried to find a way to make Goren better. She brings people here to keep him occupied. "Goren gets so lonely..." she sighs.

As she discusses the situation, people might pick up on cues suggesting the real rationale for bringing them here. When pressed, with high Insight/Persuasion checks, or as accidental asides, Anni will reveal more information:

- Something came from another world during one of Lynistad's experients, and it got into Goren and changed him.
- Goren now has an insatiable appetite, but instead of food, he must feed on the energy of living creatures.
- The party was brought here as food for Goren. "Goren gets so lonely," she repeats, "so hungry..."
- After Lynistad trapped the house in this other place, Goren eventually killed Anni and the other children, and their spirits are now trapped here, unable to move on.

Anni likes meeting new people when they arrive at Chateau Rousseau. She's sad that they'll eventualy be killed but assures them that they'll all have fun together as ghosts. She says that Ulvaeus bet they wouldn't last an hour, but she thinks they've got some fight in them and they could make it to the end of the day if they're good at hide-and-seek.

If they ask how to escape the house, Anni laughs and explains "the front door's downstairs, but only Mother knows how to open it and I haven't seen her in ages. Neta says she found out how to open the door but she refuses to tell me, what a tease. Maybe you could ask her, but she'll want something in return for it. She's usually looking for new books in the library downstairs."

If they ask for any directions in the house, she happily tells them where a given room or Rousseau ghost is, but adds: "Mother's put a clever enchantment on the doors; they like to change places when no one's looking. You can try to get there, but the doors don't always go to the right place. It doesn't bother me since I can just go through the walls, and Goren's gotten used to it and is pretty good at finding his way around. Ulvaeus found something that's supposed to help keep the doors still; maybe he'll play you for it, he loves billiards. That table's set up in the game room downstairs."

If after all this, the party asks Anni to help them complete these tasks or navigate, she'll smile and shout: "Sure! Follow me!" Without hesitation, Anni phases through the floor and disappears giggling down to the third floor, leaving the party to their own devices.

## House mechanics

The party begins this adventure in the children's room in the attic (**R1**). They can move freely between any room and hallway (with the exception of Lynistad's room), but will quickly discover that Chateau Rousseau's rooms are a shifting maze, making navigation difficult at first.

Any time a creature opens the door to a room from a hallway (except for Lynistad's room), roll a d12. The number rolled corresponds to a room number included after every room title in **House Layout** and determines which room is presented behind the door. This connection between doorway and room persists until the door is closed, resulting in one of two possibilities:

- If a creature in the hallway reopens the door, reroll for room randomization.
- If a creature in the room reopens the door, the door leads to its normal hallway.

This can easily cause party members to become separated if they are not careful. Doors softly close within a minute of being opened, unless held open by a creature or object (such as an immovable rod).

To prevent overly difficult tracking on the Dungeon Master's part, if two or more different doors are opened at once, any subsequent doors open to rooms on the same floor as the first door opened. This connection persists until all doors are closed.

The ghosts are unaffected by this room randomization as they can bypass the doors and phase through the walls. Additionally, a creature Attuned to the Mariner's Bow and looking through its scope is able to open a door to its correct room, allowing others to follow them inside. Otherwise, all doors, walls, ceilings, and floors are magically protected and strengthened such that creatures are unable to destroy them or magically pass through them.

## House layout

### Attic

#### Attic Hallway

Connects the children's room and the stairwell. The floor is covered with a dull gray carpet.

#### Children's Room (R1)

The starting room for the players and Anni. Small windows to the east and west reveal that the house is adrift in a swirling green and purple miasma. There is a single door leading to a small hallway.

### F3

#### F3 Hallway

Connects all the F3 rooms and stairwells. The floor is covered with a deep burgundy carpet. A portrait on the wall portrays Lynistad and her children. Goren's picture is torn at the face by claw marks, obscuring his appearance.

#### Play Room (R2)

A thick layer of dust covers all the furniture that would otherwise be brightly colored. Various boxes sit about filled with ancient toys in varying states of deterioration. Searching the chests reveals a _charlatan's die_ [^ðŸ§¿] and two _potions of healing_. There's a glass bowl of old candies on a table which become a **[swarm of trickered treats](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/constructs/trickered-treat.md#swarm-of-trickered-treats)** that attacks whoever attempts to pick a candy up.

#### Lynistad's Room (Râ˜…)

This room has several enchantments on it to keep the children and other potential intruders away. It cannot be entered using the house's normal room randomization, its walls and door are impenetrable and prevent passage even by ghosts, and the door is protected by both an _arcane lock_ (abjuration) spell and a _glyph of warding_ (abjuration) trap. The glyph is on the inside of the door and is thus not visible from the hallway, but can be detected with _detect magic_ or similar magic effects. The glyph is set to activate if a creature other than Lynistad attempts to pass through the doorway, and the lock will similarly only allow entry by Lynistad.

If the glyph is activated, a stored _thunderwave_ is triggered which pushes any creatures around the doorway back into the hallway (DC 19 Constitution save), emits a thunderous boom heard throughout the house which alerts Goren, and also pushes the door shut and activates a second _arcane lock_. At this point the glyph is deactivated and the party could potentially enter the room if they can remove the second lock.

Though these spells make entry seemingly impossible at first glance, a dumbwaiter connected to the kitchen downstairs could be ridden by pulling a rope and pulley. A pull rope next to the dumbwaiter door can ring a bell in the kitchen.

The room is lavishly decorated with a large bed, a private bath, and a plush red rug. Magic charms seem to prevent dust from settling on the surfaces. A chest at the foot of the bed is filled with gold and precious gems worth 300gp total, along with a _bag of devouring_ (identified as a _bag of holding_), a _potion of greater healing_, and a _spell scroll_ containing the _remove curse_ spell. A small jewelry box on the nightstand contains the _Ruby Signet_.

#### Servants' Quarters (R3)

Two small dingy beds stained with blood can be found here, along with a small box of personal effects amongst the old clothing (roll three times on the trinkets table).

### F2

#### F2 Hallway

Connects all the F2 rooms and stairwells. The floor is covered with a forest green carpet speckled in some places with drops of blood. Claw marks have been dragged across both walls leading down the halls.

#### Library (R4)

The walls are lined with bookshelves, and a lit fireplace can be seen across from the doorway. A young woman with pointed ears is floating in front of the fire, its light bending through and around her semitransparent body. She moves her hands like a conductor, and the books move in accordance, dancing in and out of the shelves as she examines their pages fervently.

See **Characters** for Neta's interaction. The party can obtain information on where to find the signet rings and the secret entrance to Lynistad's room.

#### Game Room (R5)

A cozy room with a billiards table in the center, and comfy-looking armchairs in the corners. A young elven man is holding a cue stick and eyeing his shot until he notices you enter.

See **Characters** for Ulvaeus' interaction. The party can obtain the _Mariner's Bow_ here.

#### Spare Bedroom (R6)

A single bed and nightstand are the only furniture in this sparse room. A **quickling**[^ðŸ‘¹] hiding under the bed will attack the party if disturbed, then dart out of the room. The nightstand has a _potion of speed_ in its drawer.

#### Bathroom (R7)

This room has not been cleaned in ages and emits a putrid stench when entered. The bathtub is filled with a foul opaque liquid, but if someone dares to reach into the tub, they can find an _Ioun stone of fortitude_.

#### Conservatory (R8)

A curved glass window lets in an intense green light from the southeast and provides a clear view of the miasma outside. This light shines upon some seemingly healthy-looking plants, which have overgrown the tables and floors with vines and leaves which create difficult terrain. There is a chest under the tables by the window, partly obscured by the vines of a large purple flower sitting on the table directly above it. If any creature moves within 10 feet of the chest, the flower attacks (use the **violet fungus** stat block). The chest contains two _potions of greater healing_ and the _Emerald Signet_.

### F1

#### F1 Hallway

Connects all the F1 rooms and stairwells and leads to the front door. The floor is covered with a royal blue carpet.

The front door has no handle and no keyhole. Instead, its surface is inset with three circular pads, each with a different-colored ring around it: red, green, and blue. These pads correspond to the signet rings hidden throughout the house; once all three rings are placed against their matching pads, the door will open and the House can be exited by anyone inside.

#### Kitchen (R9)

The kitchen is the only room in the house with an adjoining room; a door to the east leads directly to the dining room, and the two rooms can be passed between without triggering room randomization.

A small door to the northwest reveals a dumbwaiter with a shaft leading up to Lynistad's room; creatures can climb into the elevator one at a time and ride between the rooms by pulling the rope and pulley. There's a small bell above the door with a wire disappearing into the wall, which can be rung from Lynistad's room.

A metal door with a mirrored surface to the west is latched shut but unlocked. This door contains a walk-in ice box used to preserve meats and kept magically cold. Whoever opens the door first makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw as a cold wind blasts out of the freezer. On a failed save, the creature takes 7 (2d6) cold damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the cold damage is halved and they are not knocked prone. Once the door is opened, the wind dissipates and the space can be entered normally. Inside the freezer, the _Sapphire Signet_ can be found under a layer of frost.

#### Dining Room (R10)

The dining table has five places set, presumably for the Rousseau family. The places each have ornate tableware with fine silver and soup bowls waiting to be consumed, but whatever liquid is left in the bowls stopped being soup years ago. The silverware is worth 50gp in total.

#### Closet (R11)

A walk-in closet full of coats in varying states of decay. An **[animated pair of boots](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/constructs/animated-pair-of-boots.md)** and an **[animated corset](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/constructs/animated-corset.md)** are hiding inside and will attack if the players search the room. Once these threats are defeated, a pair of _winged boots_ can be found.

#### Ballroom (R12)

The starting room for Goren. The room contains an open floor suitable for dancing and some dusty instruments in the corners, including a piano and a harp. If Goren has not become aware of the party's presence, he will meander in and out of this room until discovered.

## Magic Items

Items are listed in alphabetical order. All items listed here serve specific purposes within the adventure.

### Signet Rings

Three rings, each inset with a different precious stone and bearing the Rousseau family seal. All three rings must be pressed against the corresponding pads on the front door to open it and leave the House, but each ring also has individual abilities. If a player Attunes to a signet ring, provide them the initial item description, but omit the curse until its conditions are triggered, unless they have some means to identify the nature of a cursed item.

### Item Descriptions

#### [Emerald Signet](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-magic-items/blob/main/rings/emerald-signet.md)
_Ring, legendary (requires Attunement)_

This silver ring is inset with an emerald which displays the Rousseau family seal in platinum lining on its surface. While Attuned to this ring, any spells you cast that restore Hit Points or add Temporary Hit Points add 1d6 to the total Hit Points gained, and you can cast the _spare the dying_ cantrip.

Additionally, the ring has 3 charges. You can cast spells through the ring using your spellcasting ability, each of which has a charge cost:

- _bless_: 1 charge
- _cure wounds_: 2 charges
- _healing word_: 2 charges
- _lesser restoration_: 3 charges

If you do not have the ability to cast spells normally, Wisdom is your spellcasting ability when casting spells through this ring. The ring regains all its charges at dawn.

**Curse.** The first time a charge has been expended, the ring glows brightly and infuses you with wild necromancy magic, subjecting you to a minor curse. While cursed in this manner, every time an ally within 30 feet of you takes damage, that damage is split evenly between you and the ally before applying resistance or immunity. Damage you take in this manner cannot be reduced. The curse persists even if you end possession of or Attunement to the ring, unless another creature Attunes to it. Otherwise, the curse ends at dawn.

#### [Mariner's Bow](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-magic-items/blob/main/weapons/mariners-bow.md)
_Weapon (shortbow), rare (requires Attunement)_

This shortbow has multiple tiny lenses embedded in the body. These lenses allow the wielder a clearer view of their target, but also are magically enchanted to see through illusions and magical barriers. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Additionally, while aiming with the bow, you can see invisible creatures and objects, and targets do not benefit from partial cover.

#### [Ruby Signet](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-magic-items/blob/main/rings/ruby-signet.md)
_Ring, legendary (requires Attunement)_

This gold ring is inset with a ruby which displays the Rousseau family seal in platinum lining on its surface. While Attuned to this ring, you gain +1 to all your melee attack rolls and grapple checks as the attacker or defender. You also gain +1 to your Armor Class.

Additionally, the ring has 3 charges. If an ally within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack you can see, as a Reaction, you can expend a charge to magically teleport and switch places with the ally, turning yourself into the target of the attack. The original attack roll is compared to your Armor Class, potentially turning the hit into a miss. The ring regains all its charges at dawn.

**Curse.** The third time a charge has been expended, the ring glows brightly and infuses you with wild conjuration magic, subjecting you to a minor curse. While cursed in this manner, unless you have already used your reaction this round, you teleport and switch places as a reaction automatically. When the teleport occurs in this manner, the triggering attack automatically hits you, and you take an additional 1d4 Necrotic damage. The curse persists even if you end possession of or Attunement to the ring, unless another creature Attunes to it. Otherwise, the curse ends at dawn.

#### [Sapphire Signet](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-magic-items/blob/main/rings/sapphire-signet.md)
_Ring, legendary (requires Attunement)_

This ring is carved from animal bone and is inset with a sapphire which displays the Rousseau family seal in platinum lining on its surface. While Attuned to this ring, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration, and you can cast the _primal savagery_[^ðŸ§¿] cantrip.

Additionally, you can cast the _polymorph_ spell through the ring using your spellcasting ability and targeting yourself. While polymorphed, all of your attacks are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance or immunity to attack damage. When selecting a target for an attack while polymorphed by the ring, you must first succeed on a DC 5 Intelligence saving throw, or your target is selected at random from all viable creatures in range as your bestial instincts temporarily take over.

If you do not have the ability to cast spells normally, Wisdom is your spellcasting ability when casting spells through this ring. Once you have cast _polymorph_ using the ring, it can't do so again until the next dawn.

**Curse.** After the _polymorph_ spell ends, the ring glows brightly and infuses you with wild transmutation magic, subjecting you to a minor curse. While cursed in this manner, whenever you take damage, you must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or you are polymorphed into a sheep for 1 minute. You can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of your turns, ending the polymorph on a successful save. The curse persists even if you end possession of or Attunement to the ring, unless another creature Attunes to it. Otherwise, the curse ends at dawn.

## The Rousseau Family

### Lynistad Rousseau

Lynistad Rousseau is the matron of the Rousseau family and mother of four children. She is a powerful mage specializing in planar travel magic. This drive to learn how to travel between the different planes led to a great tragedy that ultimately tore the Rousseaus apart and left her world in great danger.

While experimenting with arcane artifacts recently excavated from the remains of ancient civilizations, Lynistad opened a gateway to a strange reality beyond her knowledge and understanding. It was akin to another universe, where the laws of physics and magic so familiar to her didn't seem to apply. Her curiosity got the better of her, and she dipped into this doorway again and again to see what new wonders she could find.

But after one of her trips to this Far Realm, something followed Lynistad back through her portal, and quickly infected her youngest son Goren. Despite all the magic at her disposal, she was unable to restore her child to his original form, and in a moment of desperation, she shunted their entire house into a pocket dimension to protect the world from his ravenous hunger while she sought a cure. What she did not anticipate was that Goren's compulsion to eat could not be held back, and soon all the Rousseau children fell to his endless appetite.

Overcome with grief at her loss, but unable to raise a hand to her only remaining child, Lynistad continued her quest for a spell that could bring Goren back, but now took on an additional grim mission of keeping his hunger at bay by bringing him fresh food in the form of living creatures. She periodically captures people from various worlds and sends them to the House as sheep to the slaughter.

Lynistad has not confronted Goren or the ghosts of her other children since his treacherous act, feeling overwhelming responsibility and shame for what transpired. She does not appear in this adventure, but the consequences of her deeds can be found throughout the House.

### Anni Rousseau

#### Description

**Annifried Rousseau** is the eldest Rousseau who currently haunts the House with her ghost siblings.

#### Behavior

Anni's many years spent undead have given her a mature, if cavalier, view of death, and she does not begrudge Goren succumbing to his corrupted instincts. She looks forward to meeting new visitors to the House, and eventually getting to spend a lot of time with them once they die.

Anni refuses to engage in combat and will pass through the floor or ceiling to escape if attacked.

#### Movement

Anni starts the adventure in the children's room (**R1**) with the party. Unlike the other two ghosts, Anni regularly roams the House and doesn't stick to a single room. She can be found in a random room on each floor not occupied by another Rousseau ghost or Goren, and will quickly leave if Goren arrives.

### [Ulvaeus Rousseau](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/undead/ulvaeus-rousseau.md)

#### Description

**Ulvaeus Rousseau** is the second-born child of the Rousseau family and comes off as a competitive jock.

#### Behavior

This Rousseau child has a competitive streak, and is always looking for new challengers. They can be found in the game room (**R5**) playing billiards.

If the party asks them for help, they offer a valuable magic item, the Mariner's Bow, which will allow the party to navigate the House without succumbing to its door randomization. In exchange, one person must defeat Ulvaeus in a game of billiards, and agree to sacrifice some of their life force if they lose; this sacrifice subjects the individual to a minor curse which reduces their Hit Point Maximum by 1d4 Hit Points. This reduction remains until the curse is removed.

The billiards game is accomplished by a simple series of contested Dexterity or Intelligence checks. The player chooses which ability score is used by both contestants, and can change this choice each time. The first challenger to win five contests is the winner of the game. Players can also come up with alternative methods, such as attempting to cheat with Sleight of Hand (Dexterity) checks (Ulvaeus will never cheat), or their friends can assist with magic.

If the characters decline the game challenge, Ulvaeus says they'll be happy to engage in combat with the party, and will leave the bow behind as a prize if defeated.

Ulvaeus spends all their time in the game room, though they will temporarily become invisible if Goren enters the room.

#### Special traits

_**Incorporeal Movement.**_ Ulvaeus can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. They take 5 (1d10) force damage if they end their turn inside an object.

_**Sunlight Sensitivity.**_ While in sunlight, Ulvaeus has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

#### Actions

_**Rapier.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.

_**Telekinetic Thrust.**_ Ulvaeus targets a creature or unattended object within 30 feet of them. A creature must be Medium or smaller to be affected by this magic, and an object can weigh up to 150 pounds.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw, or it is hurled up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward. If the hurled creature then comes into contact with a hard surface or heavy object, the target takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet moved.

If the target is an object that isn't being worn or carried, Ulvaeus hurls it up to 30 feet in any direction. Ulvaeus can use the object as a ranged weapon, attacking one creature along the object's path (+5 to hit) and dealing 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage on a hit.

### [Neta Rousseau](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/undead/neta-rousseau.md)

#### Description

**Neta Rousseau** is the second-youngest Rousseau. She enjoys reading and is always looking for new books, but at this point she's gone through everything in the House that she can find.

#### Behavior

Neta used to wander the halls of the House but hasn't left the library (**R4**) in a very long time. If Goren enters the room, she will become invisible until he leaves.

If the party asks her for help, she will offer useful information. She learned how to leave the House after she died, and will explain how to use the signet rings and where to find two of them; she never found the _Ruby Signet_ but assumes it's in the one room she can't visit, that of her mother Lynistad. She also can tell them another route into Lynistad's room since the front door is impenetrable: the dumbwaiter in the kitchen (**R9**) connects to it directly. Before providing any of these helpful clues, she asks the party for a new book that she's never read before. This challenge is open-ended; characters can give her a journal, spell book, or any other reading material from their starting equipment, and it will generally satisfy her request.

If the party has no books to offer, she will gladly take some life force from one volunteer in exchange. This sacrifice subjects the individual to a minor curse which reduces their Hit Point Maximum by 1d4 Hit Points. This reduction remains until the curse is removed.

Like Ulvaeus, Neta also is happy to challenge the party to friendly combat for the information. If the party agrees, or if they attempt to attack Neta, a **swarm of animated books**[^ðŸ“š] begins to magically swirl about, and a **magma mephit** leaps out of the fireplace. Neta will let her creations fight for her but will defend herself if attacked.

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### [Goren Rousseau](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/aberrations/goren-rousseau.md)

#### Description

The youngest of the Rousseau children, **Goren Rousseau** was corrupted by an entity from the Far Realm. This mutation cursed him with an insatiable desire to consume the life force of other creatures, including his own siblings. He now roams the house, ashamed of his terrible actions but forever compelled to feed again.

Goren's transformation does not have a prescribed fix, as even the great Lynistad Rousseau could not find a solution as she scours the planes cannot be undone by the party. Only death can grant him a release.

#### Movement

At the start of the adventure, Goren is in the ballroom (**R12**). If Goren is unaware of the party, he mostly wanders the first floor, moving between different rooms and the hallway. Once he becomes aware that living creatures are in the House, he actively pursues them.

#### Senses

Unless the party is making successful Stealth checks against Goren's passive or active Perception (depending on whether he's tracking them), Goren will hear the group if he's up to one floor away from them, and will know what room they're in if he's on the same floor as them. Any particularly loud noises, including engaging in combat, can be easily heard by Goren up to one floor away.

The shame of his transformation has caused Goren to hate his own appearance. To that end, he has carefully covered all the mirrors in the house with blankets. If a mirror is uncovered, he averts his eyes from his reflection (see the **Negative Self-Image** trait on Goren's stat block).

Goren is unable to perceive ghosts by sight or sound. He is not aware that his siblings continue to haunt the House.

#### Special traits

_**Negative Self-Image.**_ When Goren can see his own reflection, he shields his eyes, causing him to be blinded. He then spends all his actions either trying to flee or trying to cover or destroy the reflection.

_**Spider Climb.**_ Goren can climb difficult surfaces, including upside-down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

#### Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ Goren makes up to three attacks: one with his bite, and two with his claws.

_**Bite.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's Hit Point Maximum is reduced by the amount of damage taken from Goren's bite, Goren regains that number of Hit Points, and the creature is frightened of Goren for 1 minute. The frightened creature can make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The creature's Hit Point Maximum is restored to normal after a long rest.

_**Claws.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

_**Gravity Well (3/Day).**_ Goren redirects gravity in a line in front of him 60 feet long and 10 feet wide. Any creature or object in this space must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target is knocked prone and is pulled up to 20 feet toward Goren. If this movement brings a creature within Goren's reach, he can attack the creature with his claws. On a successful save, a creature lands prone as it drops down and grabs the ground to hold its position.
