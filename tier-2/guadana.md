> [!TIP]
> This Domain of Dread was written to support a Día de los Muertos-themed one-shot for a 5th-level party as a side adventure that slots between current campaign events. Tips such as this will be peppered throughout this document to call out adjustments one could make to run this adventure as a standalone one-shot or to scale for higher-level parties.

Living curtains of marigolds replace the typical mists one might find surrounding a Domain of Dread. These are a precursor to varied arrays of flowers covering most trees in this thick forest. Despite the dense foliage, travelers will not be lost for long, as the smells of delicious food and drink waft from a point in the center of the domain, and marigolds naturally form clean pathways indicating directions of travel inward. These paths all converge on a clearing in the grove bedecked with papercraft and streamers, with the soil and walkway lit by colorful candles.

Guadaña is the name of both this cheery domain and an autumnal festival on some worlds which celebrates life transitions both natural and unnatural, respecting the raising of the undead as much as a child's birth, and everything in-between. To further this strange take on life cycles, the domain is hosted by two skeletal archfey, the brothers Dídac and Ferran.

Dídac welcomes any wandering adventurers with open arms to join in the festivities of Guadaña. He adheres strongly to the Law of Hospitality, believing that visitors to his domain must be treated as honored guests, and thus dotes upon any who enter Guadaña for their entire stay. He does not require any specific intentional reciprocity for his hospitality, but this should not be confused for reciprocation not occurring; rather, he considers participation in Guadaña's traditions to be the most precious gift one can receive. Further, since such participation involves putting oneself through a small level of risk for the possibility of reward, with the potential of undergoing minor curses or receiving temporary charms, this repayment occurs whether individuals are immediately aware of it or not. To Dídac, the game itself is his reward.

The same cannot be said of his brother. The wicked Ferran demands sacrifice in exchange for any Guadaña frivolities a creature participates in, and will take it in flesh and blood until he believes sufficient value has been paid. Ferran delights in doling out pain, and will happily take advantage of anyone Dídac has drawn in with the promise of delights. In this he carries out the ultimate trick to his brother's treats.

To prevent such misery, Dídac does his best to draw in visitors while Ferran is away participating in Gloaming Court functions such as the Wild Hunt. But inevitably, Ferran will discover Dídac's latest acquisitions and insist he has his way with them to repay the debt owed to him.

## Noteworthy Features

Those familiar with Guadaña know the following facts:

- The festival includes multiple activities in which visitors can freely participate, involving various tests of skill or chance, and all including magical treats as rewards. These are known as Los Juegos de Guadaña (The Guadañan Games).
- Dídac is directly involved in hosting all travelers to his domain as soon as they arrive, having summoned them at opportune moments when Ferran is occupied.
- People can leave the domain to return from where they came after partaking in the games and food Dídac provides.
- Ferran will ultimately break up the party and start a fight with the visitors to extract payment for Dídac's services in blood.

## Settlements and Sites

This tiny domain encompasses only a few hundred square yards of clearing amidst a dark forest. There is no visible sun, and the clearing where Dídac hosts guests is lit by hundreds of flickering candles and paper lanterns.

## Dídac and Ferran

Dídac and Ferran, the hosts of Guadaña, are skeletal undead archfey. They both use the _bone knight_[^⚙️] stat block with a +4 proficiency bonus and the following traits:

_**Creature Type.**_ The archfey is fey and undead.

_**Fey Rebirth.**_ If the archfey dies in Guadaña, he revives with all his hit points 1d4 days later in the spot where he died.

_**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).**_ If the archfey fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

### Dídac

In addition to the stat block modifications shared with his brother, Dídac is lawful neutral, has Strength 10 (+0), Dexterity 14 (+2), Charisma 20 (+5), wields a rapier instead of a greatsword and longbow, and has the following modified trait:

_**Spellcasting.**_ Dídac is an 11th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, spell attack modifier +9). He knows the spells from the _warlock of the Archfey_ stat block and can cast them without spending material components.

He can generally be found with a group of esqueletos de azúcar that dance about to reflect his glee.

### Ferran

In addition to the stat block modifications shared with his brother, Ferran is lawful evil and has the following modified trait:

_**Spellcasting.**_ Ferran is an 11th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, spell attack modifier +7). He has the following paladin spells prepared and can cast them without spending material components:

- 1st level (4 slots): _cause fear_, _command_, _compelled duel_, _hellish rebuke_, _wrathful smite_
- 2nd level (3 slots): _branding smite_, _crown of madness_, _darkness_
- 3rd level (3 slots): _animate dead_, _bestow curse_, _revivify_

#### Ferran's Reciprocity

When Ferran arrives and demands blood from the party, he summons three _skeletons_, one [grinning gourd](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/plants/grinning-gourd.md), and one _undead spirit_ in its Ghostly form (use the stat block from the _summon undead_ spell and calculate stats as if Ferran cast the spell) to fight on his behalf.

Once Ferran's minions have been defeated, or once two party members fall unconscious, Ferran is satisfied with their payment and his bloodlust is slaked for the time being. He revives any fallen party members and allows them to complete their Guadaña celebrations in peace before Dídac sends them on their way home.

After Ferran has finished torturing the party in his pursuit of blood payment, Dídac profusely apologizes for the unpleasantness, then gives every attendee some **pan de muerto (bread of the dead)** as a parting gift.

> [!TIP]
> The fight with Ferran's undead warriors is the only intended combat encounter, which should be adjusted as needed depending on party size and average level.

  Dídac generally doesn't get involved in combat as he would much rather happily cavort with visitors, but he defends himself as necessary and will _dimension door_ away if in any sort of danger. Ferran opts to send skeleton minions into battle rather than getting his hands dirty, but will strike down hard against any who attack him directly. If the party is sufficiently high-level, Ferran could fight alongside his minions for a tougher challenge, in which case he will not yield until either he or all the players are defeated.

## Juegos de Guadaña

### Battle of the Bands

Any party members who want to participate can group up as a band. Each round constitutes a group Charisma (Performance) check against a competing band and judged by a crowd of onlookers. Participants can take other actions during their turn to either give advantage to a fellow band member's Performance check or to provide a different skill to the group check.

The DC for the group Performance check starts at 13. Each time the group succeeds on a check, the DC is lowered by 2 as the crowd is swayed toward them. Each time the group fails this check, the DC is increased by 1 as the crowd jeers them and supports the other band. The group neither succeeds nor fails on a tie.

The challenge ends when the party's band either succeeds or fails three times. If the band wins, each participant is awarded with una **calavera de azúcar (sugar skull)**.

### Bobbing for Manzanas

A large barrel full of cider has 7 candy apples floating on top. A creature that succeeds on a DC 14 Dexterity check can use their teeth to retrieve una **manzana caramelada (candy apple)**.

### High Striker

A high striker carnival game with a mallet and a pressure pad. A creature that succeeds on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check rings the bell and wins a pitcher of atole.

### Muchas Cosas

Atop a short pedestal is a set of gilt, hand-painted cards with a leather case. With a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check, a player might identify this as a _Deck of Many Things_, and it does function similarly, but the cards instead provide a series of effects similar to those of supernatural charms or magical curses. Dídac identifies this card game as "Muchas Cosas" ("Many Things") and insists it's completely different from whatever this "Deck of Many Things" is that the party speaks of.

A participant is only permitted to draw a single card per day; any cards drawn in excess of this have no effect. As soon as they draw their card from the deck, its magic takes effect (see the Muchas Cosas table for all card effects; cards can be drawn from the Major Arcana cards in a tarot deck). Effects tied to existing resources reference the book in which they appear. Any curse subjected by a card lasts until the next dawn, which will not occur as long as the Cursed creature remains in Guadaña.

Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence, then reappears in the deck.

If a participant becomes Cursed by a drawn card, Dídac gives them some **calabaza en tacha (candied pumpkin)** as a consolation prize.

> [!TIP]
> The prizes and curses granted in Los Juegos de Guadaña are intended to be brought back into a longer campaign as short-term effects, but this one-shot could easily occur outside of any existing campaign canon as a standalone story.

  Almost all the awards are single- or limited-use, but one could increase their power for more potent or permanent effects; replacing them with blessings, feats, or epic boons would be a simple modification. Similarly, the curses all end at the next dawn (after leaving Guadaña) and can be removed with any spell or effect that ends curses, but these can also be made more potent and more difficult to cure. _Domains of Delight: A Feywild Accessory_ has many great suggestions for fey curses and punishments which were used as inspiration for some of the curses presented here, and has a table for more complex requirements to end fey curses.

### Pepper Challenge

(this is a lightly modified version of a challenge in _Journeys Through the Radiant Citadel_)

All participants sit around a table and are given a bowl full of assorted peppers and a glass of milk. Challengers eat their peppers one at a time in initiative order, which is also how the participants are arranged clockwise around the table.

On their turn during each round, each participating character must choose a pepper from the basket and eat it. The peppers do not visually reveal their taste or intensity. The character must roll on the Random Spicy Pepper table to determine what sort of pepper they pull, along with any special effects that pepper has. The character must then make a Constitution saving throw. The DC depends on the pepper they chose. On a successful saving throw, they manage to eat it. On a failed saving throw, after they eat the pepper, they must choose to either drink their milk and drop out, or they take 1d10 fire damage and have disadvantage on the next saving throw they make during the challenge.

Challengers reduced to 0 hit points are disqualified and healed by a medic for 30 hit points.

##### Random Spicy Pepper
| d10 | Pepper |
|:---:|:-------|
|  1  | **Dud!** The pepper is not spicy at all. You do not need to make a saving throw. |
| 2-4 | **Common Pepper (DC 10).** This pepper has no special effects. |
| 5-6 | **Sweet Heat Pepper (DC 12).** The pepper is hot but delicious. You do not have disadvantage on this saving throw if you would normally have it as a result of eating another pepper. |
| 7-8 | **Chile Caótico (DC 16).** This pepper pulsates with wild magic energy. Before making your saving throw against this pepper, you must roll on the Wild Magic Surge table from the _Player's Handbook_ to create a magical effect. If that effect is a spell, it is cast using a Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature of your choice that you have access to, it is too wild to be affected by Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration. If you do not have the ability to cast spells normally, any spells cast through this effect use Constitution as your spellcasting ability. |
|  9  | **Cinnamon-Infused Pepper (DC 18).** If you fail your saving throw against this pepper, you belch or gasp a cloud of cinnamon dust into the air. The next challenge participant to eat a pepper has disadvantage on their saving throw. |
| 10  | **Ghost Pepper (DC 20).** The spice is intense. You can see a faint aura around undead creatures for the next hour. |

The challenge ends when all but one participant are disqualified or drop out, or when any participants succeed on their third saving throws in the same round. Winners are awarded with un **dulce de chile caótico** (chaos chili chocolate).
