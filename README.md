# dnd5e-adventures

This is a collection of adventures written for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition.

## General notes

At minimum, Dungeon Masters will need the _Dungeon Master's Guide_ and the _Monster Manual_ to run these adventures. Creatures and magic items from these sources are **bolded** and _italicized_ respectively. Stat blocks are also included for new or reskinned creatures and magic items; if a creature or magic item is not in the _Dungeon Master's Guide_ or _Monster Manual_, it will either include a link (for content I've created in other sources) or be marked with a footnote indicating its source.

Any adventure including potentially sensitive topics will be preceded with a relevant content warning. I encourage you to set clear boundaries and expectation at your gaming table, ensuring that we keep the hobby inclusive and inviting to all. I've found Monte Cook's **Consent in Gaming** to be and excellent safety tool for your games (see **Third-Party Content References** below), but feel free to use whatever such tools you prefer.

Most of the adventures in this document rely on "theater of the mind" and do not include maps.

## Table of Contents

## Compatibility

This content was written to be compatible with Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. It makes the following modifications from the _Systems Reference Document_:

- "Species" is used in place of "race" and "ancestry" or "variant" in place of "subrace".
- This document uses new traits called **Condition Resistance** and **Condition Vulnerability**. Resistance to a condition means that a creature has Advantage on Saving Throws made to resist that condition, and vulnerability to a condition means that a creature has Disadvantage on such Saving Throws.
- Damage and condition resistance, vulnerability, and immunity are now grouped together as **Resistances**, **Vulnerabilities**, and **Immunities** respectively.
- Resistance, vulnerability, and immunity to Poison apply to both the damage type and the Poisoned condition.
