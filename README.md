# dnd5e-adventures

This is a collection of adventures written for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition.

Any adventure including potentially sensitive topics will have a prominent **content warning** at the start of the document. I recommend using Monte Cook's excellent **Consent in Gaming** as a safety tool for your games (see **Third-Party Content References** below), but feel free to use whatever such tools you prefer.

## Table of Contents

Adventures are organized by tier of play and corresponding recommended party levels.

- Tier 1 (Levels 1-4)
- Tier 2 (Levels 5-10)
  - [Chateau Rousseau](tier-2/chateau-rousseau.md)
- Tier 3 (Levels 11-16)
- Tier 4 (Levels 17-20)

## Compatibility

This content was written to be compatible with Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. It makes the following modifications from the _Systems Reference Document_:

- "Species" is used in place of "race" and "ancestry" or "variant" in place of "subrace".
- This document uses new traits called **Condition Resistance** and **Condition Vulnerability**. Resistance to a condition means that a creature has Advantage on Saving Throws made to resist that condition, and vulnerability to a condition means that a creature has Disadvantage on such Saving Throws.
- Damage and condition resistance, vulnerability, and immunity are now grouped together as **Resistances**, **Vulnerabilities**, and **Immunities** respectively.
- Resistance, vulnerability, and immunity to Poison apply to both the damage type and the Poisoned condition.
